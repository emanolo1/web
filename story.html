            <p><strong>Emanuel was so close to die</strong></p>
            <p>
            When I was a child, my family rented a place to go on vacation with a shared pool. In the first days, the adults decided to let the children, including me, enter the pool, but only on the shore because there was no wading pool and no child knew how to swim. Aunt told us: "Don't get up" and the first thing Emanuel did was get up, I started to drown but I started swimming without knowing how to swim, I just swam in the opposite direction to the people who could help me and I headed towards the depth, finally they reached me but I almost ran out of oxygen.

            My parents told me that when I was a child who barely walked, we went to Acapulco and I just walked along the shore of the beach but the waves of the sea pushed me and threw me, I got angry and then I kicked the waves but they threw me again, I was a long time without giving up until my parents took me to do other activities.

            <p><strong>Aremy's story</strong></p>
            <p>
            When I was a child in primary school, it had an ugly and dilapidated entrance that take to the back of the reading room. A teacher told us that once a boy went in there and when they went to look for him, he was died. Now he is a ghost. We didn't believe him. So during the break we decided to go to where he had supposedly disappeared, we didn't find anything but my friends screamed and we all got scared and ran out of there.
