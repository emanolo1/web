        When I was in high school the physical education teacher did a resistance exercise. There were two marks along the yard and he had a speaker from which you could hear a beep and indicate that you had to have reached the other mark. In the end, only two of us were left in the test but we left because the class ended, we were running the entire class hour

        This story took place when I was 12 years old, I was in my house eat a candy in the bed I was in a weird position I remamber that my brother was there with me, in the houe, no besides me, then i was eating the candy and suddenly I start to feel sick well I was choked whit the candy and I think I pased like 3 minutes in that situation it feesl very worrying and suffocating and to be honest I felt like “well I’m die” and I try to got help from my brother but well he was a kid like me in that moment so he doesn’t know what he can do in that kind of case and I couldn’t speak in that moment because the candy was in my windpipe so I don’t know how but I was thinking something like “I have seen some televisión programs where they comrpres the mouth of the stomach to hel the person breathe again” and my parents were not there at that time because they worked a lot to support us, so I start to compres the stomach but I didn't have enough back support to do it myself and my brother couldn't do anything because of the fear he had at that moment, so I stood with my back against a wall and started doing the classic movement that you see in the series and very hard then in some way and the truth is that by a lot of luck I was able to get it out.
